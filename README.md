# nRF 802.15.4 sniffer

This repository contains firmware and Wireshark extcap script that can be used with nRF52840 chip as an 802.15.4 sniffer.

__Note:__ this project is experimental.

The software provided has been tested with the nRF52840-DK board and the following operating systems:
* Ubuntu 18.04 (Wireshark 2.4.5 from the official package, Wireshark 2.6.4)
* Windows 10 (Wireshark 2.6.3)
* macOS Mojave (Wireshark 2.6.4)

## Dependencies
* Wireshark (Ubuntu package `wireshark`)
* pySerial (Ubuntu package `python-serial` or `python3-serial`)

## Quick start guide

To start using the sniffer, you must flash the firmware, install the script, and configure the sniffer in Wireshark.

### Flash firmware

#### nRF52840-DK (PCA10056)
1. Connect the nRF52840-DK to the PC with an USB cable by connecting it to the J2 USB port.
2. Flash the firmware with the following command:
```
nrfjprog -f nrf52 --program nrf802154_sniffer/nrf802154_sniffer.hex --chiperase -r
```
3. J2 USB port can now be optionally disconnected.
4. Connect the nRF52840-DK to J3 nRF USB port.

__Note:__ Sniffer firmware can no longer transport captured packets over J2 USB port. Capture can be carried out using only the J3 nRF USB port.

#### nRF52840-Dongle (PCA10059)

1. Download and install [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop).
2. Click `Add/remove apps` and install `Programmer` application.
3. Plug the dongle to USB port and click reset button to enter DFU mode. Red diode should start blinking.
4. Select `Nordic Semiconductor DFU Bootloader` device from the list.
5. Click `Add HEX file` and select `nrf802154_sniffer_dongle.hex` from `nrf802154_sniffer` directory.
6. Verify that the selected application begins at the `0x00001000` address to avoid overwriting the MBR section.
7. Click `Write` to flash the device.
8. Unplug the dongle from the USB port and plug it again. Do not click the reset button.

### Install extcap script

To find the correct installation path of the extcap utility on any system please see:
```
"Help" -> "About Wireshark" -> "Folders" -> "Extcap path"
```
Copy the provided `nrf802154_sniffer.py` script to the extcap directory.

__Note to Windows users:__ `nrf802154_sniffer.bat` has to be copied to the same directory as well.
Ensure that Python directory is included in your `PATH` system environment variable.

### Configuring the system

#### Ubuntu Linux
1. During the Wireshark installation on Ubuntu the user will be prompted to choose one of the following options:
    * Create the `wireshark` user group and allow all members of that group to capture packets.
    * Only allow the root user to capture packets.

    __Note:__ Using the Wireshark as the root user is strongly discouraged.

    To change the settings after the installation, run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
    ```

    If the Wireshark was configured to restrict the capture to members of the `wireshark` group, add the correct user to the group:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G wireshark [user]
    ```
2. Add the correct user to the `dialout` group:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout [user]
    ```
3. Log-out and log-in again to apply the new user group settings.
4. Install the Python interpreter. The recommended version is `3.7`.
5. Install the `pySerial` module. To install it, run one of the following commands:
    - Using Ubuntu's native package manager:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install python-serial
        ```
        Or alternatively:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install python3-serial
        ```
    - Using Python's pip package manager:
        ```bash
        sudo pip install pyserial
        ```
#### Windows 10
1. Install the python interpreter. The recommended version is `3.7`. Make sure to check the `Add Python to environment variables` option during installation.
2. Install the `pySerial` module using the Python's pip package manager:
    ```bash
    sudo pip install pyserial
    ```

### Start sniffing
1. Run Wireshark.
2. Click the gear icon next to the 'nRF 802.15.4 sniffer'.
3. Select the 802.15.4 channel.
4. Select the format for out-of-band meta-data.
5. Click 'Start'.

## Wireshark configuration for Thread

### Decryption key

To decode packets exchanged on the Thread network, you must configure the Wireshark to use the correct decryption keys.
1. Go to `Edit -> Preferences... -> Protocols -> IEEE 802.15.4 -> Decryption Keys`.
2. Configure the following values:
    - Decryption key: `00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff` (default value used by the Nordic Thread and Zigbee SDK examples)
    - Decryption key index:`0`
    - Key hash: `Thread hash`

### CoAP port configuration

Thread uses the CoAP protocol on port 61631 for network data exchange. To correctly decode packets sent over that port, you can use one of the following options:
* Apply the setting globally by editing CoAP protocol settings in `Preferences` and changing the `CoAP UDP port` value to `61631`.
* Apply the setting on per-capture basis by adding an entry to `Analyze -> Decode as...` with the following values:
    - `Field`: `UDP port`
    - `Value`:`61631`
    - `Current`: `CoAP`

### 6loWPAN contexts

Go to 6loWPAN settings in `Preferences` window and add correct values. Contexts may vary depending on the Thread Network Data. Below values are used by Thread examples in nRF5 SDK.
* Context 0: `fdde:ad00:beef:0::/64`
* Context 1: `fd11:22::/64`

### Disable unwanted protocols (optional)

If Wireshark uses incorrect dissectors to decode a message you have an option to disable unwanted protocols. Go to `Analyze -> Enabled protocols` and uncheck unwanted protocols. Suggestions below.
* LwMesh
* ZigBee
* ZigBee Green Power

## Configuring Wireshark for Zigbee

To capture the data for Zigbee examples in SDK, you must manually configure Wireshark:
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + P to enter the Wireshark preferences.
2. Go to `Protocols -> Zigbee`.
3. Click the `Edit` button next to Pre-configured Keys. The Pre-configured Keys window appears.
4. Add two entries by clicking on the "+" button:
    - Key: `5A:69:67:42:65:65:41:6C:6C:69:61:6E:63:65:30:39`, Byte Order: Normal, Label: ZigbeeAlliance09
    - Key: `ab:cd:ef:01:23:45:67:89:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00`, Byte Order: Normal, Label: Nordic Examples

## Out-Of-Band meta-data
The sniffer can provide additional information. For every packet, you can display channel, RSSI and LQI. The format used for this is configurable in the Interface Options dialog (the gear icon next to the 'nRF 802.15.4 sniffer'). Depending on the Wireshark version this can be configured in two ways:

1. For Wireshark 3.0 and later: Select "IEEE 802.15.4 TAP".
2. For Wireshark 2.4 and 2.6: Install a custom Lua dissector and select "Custom Lua dissector".

### Install Lua dissector
Copy the provided script to the appropriate directory (it can be found in `About Wireshark -> Folders -> Personal Lua Plugins`).
If the directory is not displayed, ensure that the Wireshark was built with Lua support. This can be checked in the `About Wireshark` window.

## Indicator LEDs

The firmware uses the following LEDs to indicate operation:
* PCA10056:
    - LED1 - toggled continuously
    - LED4 - toggled when new frame is received
* PCA10059:
    - green LD1 - toggled continuously
    - blue LD2 - toggled when new frame is received

## Troubleshooting

See the sections below for the description of several known issues with the respective workarounds.

### Sniffer capture hangs when another Wireshark process is started
If you have other extcap scripts installed, ensure that they do not send any data to serial ports.
For instance, the Nordic BLE sniffer extcap discovers connected BLE sniffers during Wireshark startup by actively sending data to all serial ports.
Because Linux applications primarily use advisory locking, there is nothing stopping other applications from opening and writing data to a serial port, causing unexpected behaviour.
Currently, the only way to avoid this issue is to disable the offending script by removing the `executable` permission:
```bash
sudo chmod -x <extcap_file>
```

### Sniffer capture hangs with `ModemManager` service enabled on Linux
On some occasions, the `ModemManager` may send AT commands to the sniffer. To avoid this, use one of the following options:
* Disable `ModemManager` service:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop ModemManager.service
sudo systemctl disable ModemManager.service
```
* If `ModemManager` runs on `DEFAULT` or `PARANOID` policy, create `udev` rule:

  __Note__: The below steps will not work if `STRICT` policy of the `ModemManager` is used.

    1. Create new file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-mm-blacklist.rules` and include in it the following configuration:
        ```
        ACTION!="add", SUBSYSTEM!="usb_device", GOTO="mm_blacklist_rules_end"

        ATTR{idProduct}=="154a", ATTR{idVendor}=="1915", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"

        LABEL="mm_blacklist_rules_end"
        ```
    2. Apply the new `udev` rules:
        ```bash
        udevadm trigger
        ```
    3. Verify that the settings have been successfully applied:
        ```bash
        udevadm info -q property -n /dev/ttyACMx
        ```
        The following values confirm the settings are correctly applied:
        ```
        ID_MM_CANDIDATE=0
        ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE=1
        ```
    4. Restart the `ModemManager`:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart ModemManager
        ```

### Sniffer interface does not appear in the Wireshark

This issue can affect both Ubuntu Linux and Windows.

#### On Ubuntu Linux
If you have multiple Python interpreters installed, ensure that `pySerial` module was installed for the correct Python interpreter used by the extcap script.
If that does not help, you may not have sufficient permissions to access the serial device. Please refer to `Configuring the system` section.

#### On Windows
Ensure that the Python installation directory is included in the `PATH` environment variable and that the correct interpreter with `pySerial` installed is used.

If during Python installation the `Add Python to environment variables` option was unchecked, you can add the entry manually by doing the following steps:
1. Open the `Control Panel` and search for `Advanced system settings`.
2. Click `Environment variables...`.
3. In `System variables` window, double click the `PATH` variable.
4. Append the Python installation directory at the end.

To verify that everything is correct, run:
```
$ python
Python 2.7.15 (v2.7.15:ca079a3ea3, Apr 30 2018, 16:30:26) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import serial
```
If there are no errors, the configuration was done correctly.
